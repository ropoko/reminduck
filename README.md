## Inspired by ... 
I'm an elementary os user, and I love the apps that are built exclusively for it, but reminduck in special touched my heart, so joining my willingness to learn electron and
the inspiration with the [reminduck built for elementary](https://github.com/matfantinel/reminduck), I built this another version.

## Developing
